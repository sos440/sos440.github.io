I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Computational Science Research Center (CSRC) of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), starting in 2023.

Prior to this, I was an Assistant Professor (RTPC) of Mathematics at the University of Southern California (USC).

In 2019, I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), under the guidance of Professor Marek Biskup.
